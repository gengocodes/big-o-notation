# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains Python demos for common **data structures** and **Big O concepts**, including lists, sets, stacks, queues, hash tables, graphs, and heaps. It also provides examples for basic time complexities like O(1), O(n), O(log n), and O(n²).

## Big O Notation Examples

| Concept  | Use Case                 | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| -------- | ------------------------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(1)     | Access a single element  | Constant        | Constant         |
| O(n)     | Iterating through a list | Linear          | Linear           |
| O(log n) | Binary search            | Logarithmic     | Constant         |
| O(n²)    | Nested loops             | Quadratic       | Linear           |

## Data Structures

| Data Structure | Use Case                                  | Time Complexity (Average)                       | Space Complexity |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| List           | Ordered collection, allow duplicates      | Access: O(1), Search: O(n), Insert/Delete: O(n) | O(n)             |
| Set            | Unique collection, fast membership check  | Add/Remove/Lookup: O(1)                         | O(n)             |
| Stack (LIFO)   | Undo functionality, expression evaluation | Push/Pop: O(1)                                  | O(n)             |
| Queue (FIFO)   | Task scheduling, buffering                | Enqueue/Dequeue: O(1)                           | O(n)             |
| Hash Table     | Fast key-value lookup                     | Insert/Search/Delete: O(1)                      | O(n)             |
| Graph          | Represent relationships, networks         | BFS/DFS: O(V+E)                                 | O(V+E)           |
| Heap           | Priority queue, top-k problems            | Insert/Delete: O(log n), Peek: O(1)             | O(n)             |

This repository has been created to keep notes of my learning in the Meta Coding Interview Preparation Certification course.
